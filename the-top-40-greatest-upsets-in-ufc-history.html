No matter how dominant a fighter may appear, there is always a chance for an upset. Throughout the history of the UFC, there have been numerous shocking victories that have left fans and experts alike in awe. In this article, we will countdown the 50 biggest upsets in UFC history, highlighting the fights that defied expectations and changed the course of the sport.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>50. K.J. Noons Def. Nick Diaz Via First-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2007, upstart promotion EliteXC created a 160-pound division and pitted Nick Diaz against K.J. Noons for the newly created title. Diaz, already a well-established fighter, was expected to easily defeat Noons and become one of the faces of the new promotion. However, Noons had other plans.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>From the start of the fight, Noons landed a series of straight right hands that rocked Diaz. Despite Diaz's reputation for being tough and resilient, he couldn't withstand the barrage of punches. By the end of the first round, Diaz had massive gashes above both of his eyes, and the fight was called off. Noons shocked the world and left Diaz furious with the call.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>49. Josh Thomson Def. Gilbert Melendez Via Unanimous Decision</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>In a highly anticipated battle of Bay Area lightweights, Gilbert Melendez was set to defend his Strikeforce title against Josh Thomson. Melendez was a heavy favorite, having only lost once in a competitive fight with Mitsuhiro Ishida the previous year. However, Thomson had other plans.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>In June of 2008, the two met in a five-round classic that saw Thomson utilize leg kicks, wrestling, and boxing to win all five rounds. To the dismay of the crowd, Thomson kept his distance in the final minutes, knowing he had already won the fight. Melendez never stopped coming forward, but it wasn't enough to secure the victory. The two would later rematch, with Melendez reclaiming his title.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>48. Kevin Burns Def. Roan Carneiro Via Second-Round Submission</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>At UFC 85, Kevin Burns, an unknown fighter making his UFC debut, faced off against experienced jiu-jitsu black belt Roan Carneiro. Burns was considered a massive underdog with little chance against the American Top Team veteran.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>However, Burns showed his mettle by outworking Carneiro on the ground and holding his own against the decorated black belt. Halfway through the second round, Carneiro got on top, but Burns locked in a triangle choke, forcing Carneiro to tap. It was a shocking win for the relatively unknown fighter and a testament to the unpredictable nature of MMA.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>47. Pete Spratt Def. Robbie Lawler Via Second-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2003, Pete Spratt was a journeyman with a checkered resume and a 1-1 UFC record. He was expected to be another opportunity for the UFC to showcase their rising star, Robbie Lawler, who was 7-0 and trained with the same camp as Matt Hughes, the welterweight champion at the time.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>At UFC 42, Spratt came out determined and sharp, using heavy leg kicks and superior athleticism to outwork the less experienced Lawler. In the middle of the second round, Lawler was forced to quit with his legs barely holding him up. Spratt's victory shocked the MMA world, but he turned down a shot at the welterweight champ, stating he wasn't ready for Hughes just yet.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>46. Jason Lambert Def. Renato Sobral Via Second-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>Renato Sobral had earned himself a title shot against Chuck Liddell in the UFC, but his championship dreams were squashed after a minute and a half of an ill-advised game plan consisting of running straight at Liddell. Still, Sobral was a top ten light heavyweight and would be favored against most competition, especially Jason Lambert, who was coming off a knockout loss to Rashad Evans.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>The two faced off at UFC 68, and in the second round of a fight Sobral was likely winning, they were stood up from the ground. Sobral attempted a reckless flying knee immediately after the fight restarted, but Lambert countered with a strong left hand, knocking Sobral out. It was a stunning upset that showcased the unpredictable nature of MMA.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>45. Wanderlei Silva Def. Kazushi Sakuraba Via First-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>When Wanderlei Silva first met Kazushi Sakuraba, Silva was actually expected to lose. Sakuraba was considered by most to be the pound-for-pound best fighter in MMA at the time. However, Silva quickly recouped after being knocked down early in the fight and stopped Sakuraba with knees to the head on the ground. After the fight, Sakuraba presented Silva with his belt, and Silva offered Sakuraba a rematch.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>44. Seth Petruzelli Def. Kimbo Slice Via First-Round TKO</h2><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kimbo Slice was briefly thought to be a legitimate competitor in MMA. His aggressiveness, punching power, and massive following had him headlining EliteXC events. However, when Slice was set to take on the aging Ken Shamrock, Shamrock was forced to withdraw due to a cut, and Seth Petruzelli stepped in as a replacement.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><p data-mce-fragment=1>In the opening seconds of the fight, Petruzelli dropped Kimbo with a single jab to the chin, shocking the MMA world. Kimbo was stopped in just 14 seconds, and the farce of his perceived dominance was exposed. It was a stunning upset that revealed the vulnerability of even the most hyped fighters.</p><span data-mce-fragment=1></span><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>43. Tim Sylvia Def.
